## About This Project

This project is a single-page, responsive web application designed to present my work in a clear, engaging, and professional manner. It features a modern design built with Tailwind CSS, interactive elements, and dynamic visual effects.

## Features

* **Dynamic Dark/Light Theme:** A fully functional theme switcher that significantly changes the page's aesthetic for comfortable viewing in different lighting conditions.
* **Animated Name in Header:** My name in the top-left corner features a creative "breaking and joining" word effect on page load, adding a unique and eye-catching touch.
* **Interactive About Me Section:** Showcases a rotating carousel of images (`a1.jpeg` to `a5.jpeg`) that automatically swaps with a smooth fade transition.
* **Comprehensive Skills Overview:** Detailed breakdown of my technical proficiencies.
* **Showcase of 5 Key Projects:**
    * AI Powered Pneumonia Detection
    * Stock Portfolio Heatmap Analyser
    * Smart Research Assistant
    * BloodBank Management System
    * Portfolio Builder (This very website!)
* **Project Detail Modals:** Each project card has a "View Details" button that opens a creative pop-up window. This modal displays a detailed description (initially "description text", which you can customize), a direct GitHub repository link, and a "View Project" button (linking to `https://xyz.com`).
* **LLM-Powered Description Enhancement:** An integrated feature (using Google Gemini API) within the project detail modal to generate enhanced project descriptions.
* **Professional Experience Timeline:** A clear, responsive timeline of my internships and achievements. Each experience item has a "View Details" button that opens a pop-up with more specific information (initially "xyz...").
* **Certifications Section:** Highlights my professional certifications, now with 12 entries (6 original, 6 duplicates for easy customization). Each includes a "View Certificate" button linking to `https://google.com`.
* **"My Resume" Button:** A prominent button in the navigation (both desktop and mobile) that links directly to your resume on OneDrive (`YOUR_ONEDRIVE_RESUME_LINK`).
* **Highly Creative & Dynamic Effects:** Beyond specific features, the entire site incorporates various animations, hover effects, and a dynamic gradient background in the hero section to provide a modern and engaging user experience.
* **Professional Typography & Styling:** Consistent use of "Inter" font, professional text sizes, and a clean layout adhering to modern design standards.
* **Fully Responsive Design:** Optimized for seamless viewing across all devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).

## Technologies Used

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
* **Framework/Library:** Tailwind CSS
* **Fonts:** Google Fonts (Inter)
* **API Integration:** Google Gemini API (for project description enhancement)

## Installation and Local Setup

    git clone [https://github.com/gomit32/My_Portfolio_Website.git](https://github.com/gomit32/My_Portfolio_Website.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

## Customization

You can easily customize this portfolio:

* **Content:** Update all placeholder text (e.g., "description text", "xyz...", dates) with your actual project details, experience descriptions, and certification information.
* **Images:** Replace `my_img.jpeg` (profile picture), `one.png`, `two.png`, `three.png`, `four.png`, `five.png` (project images), and `a1.jpeg` to `a5.jpeg` (about me carousel images) with your own image files. Ensure they are in the same root directory as `index.html`.
* **Links:** Update all GitHub and Live Demo links for each project, the "My Resume" link (`YOUR_ONEDRIVE_RESUME_LINK`), your social media links, and certification links.
* **Theme Colors:** While the dark/light mode is robust, you can further tweak colors by modifying the Tailwind CSS classes or the custom CSS variables in the `<style>` block.
* **Animations:** Adjust the timing or type of animations in the `<style>` block if desired.
* **Gemini API Key:** The Gemini API integration uses a placeholder `apiKey = ""`. For actual use outside of the Canvas environment, this would typically be handled more securely (e.g., via environment variables or a proxy).
